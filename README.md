# TRAFFIC-LIGHT-DETECTOR
Developed a traffic light detector using a YOLO model, capable of processing both images and videos.
I used the yolov3 model to acheive  <img width="834" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-26 at 17 40 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b9893f-3705-4c43-950d-0dfda22023ce" />
# Traffic Light Detection with YOLOv8  

This repository contains three trained YOLOv8 models designed to detect traffic lights and classify their colors. The models are available in different sizesâ€”Nano, Small, and Mediumâ€”offering a trade-off between speed and accuracy depending on your hardware and requirements.  

## ðŸ“‚ Models  

| Model File                   | Description                                  |  
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| `best_traffic_nano_yolo.pt`  | YOLOv8 Nano â€“ optimized for speed.          |  
| `best_traffic_small_yolo.pt` | YOLOv8 Small â€“ balance between speed & accuracy. |  
| `best_traffic_med_yolo_v8.pt` | YOLOv8 Medium â€“ higher accuracy, but slower. |  

## âš¡ Model Performance  

The following table shows the execution time of each model when tested on a Mac M1 Max (CPU only):  

| Model Size | Execution Time (ms) | Hardware |  
|------------|---------------------|----------|  
| Nano       | 43.7                | Mac M1 Max (CPU) |  
| Small      | 72.1                | Mac M1 Max (CPU) |  
| Medium     | 130.2               | Mac M1 Max (CPU) |  

## ðŸš€ Usage  

### Running a Live Test  
To test the model in real time using a webcam, run the `livetest.py` script:  

```bash
python livetest.py --model <path_to_model.pt>
